I am a researcher in biomedical AI with a focus on wearable data algorithm development and precision health. I earned my Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Duke University, where I developed wearable-based sleep staging algorithms and explored the application of longitudinal sleep monitoring in managing physical and mental health. I have a strong interest in driving the integration of physiological signals with electronic health records for personalized health monitoring.
