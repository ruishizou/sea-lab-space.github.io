I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at UC San Diego. My research interests lie in Human-Computer Interaction and Visualization, with a specific emphasis on designing human-AI systems to empower humans in understanding complex, multimodal information. My vision is to improve the experience and outcome of healthcare stakeholders through human-AI systems.
