# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am an incoming master's student at Columbia University with a deep interest in machine learning and human-computer interaction. I completed my undergraduate degree at Santa Clara University in 2025, where I worked in the school's HCI Lab to develop an application scraping tool for non-technical researchers. I look forward to learning more about computer science and healthcare through contributing to the SEA lab.
