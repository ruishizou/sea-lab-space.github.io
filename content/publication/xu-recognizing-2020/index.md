abstract: A multi-touch interactive tabletop is designed to embody the benefits of
  a digital computer within the familiar surface of a physical tabletop. However,
  the nature of current multi-touch tabletops to detect and react to all forms of
  touch, including unintentional touches, impedes users from acting naturally on them.
  In our research, we leverage gaze direction, head orientation and screen contact
  data to identify and filter out unintentional touches, so that users can take full
  advantage of the physical properties of an interactive tabletop, e.g., resting hands
  or leaning on the tabletop during the interaction. To achieve this, we first conducted
  a user study to identify behavioral pattern differences (gaze, head and touch) between
  completing usual tasks on digital versus physical tabletops. We then compiled our
  findings into five types of spatiotemporal features, and train a machine learning
  model to recognize unintentional touches with an F1 score of 91.3%, outperforming
  the state-of-the-art model by 4.3%. Finally we evaluated our algorithm in a real-time
  filtering system. A user study shows that our algorithm is stable and the improved
  tabletop effectively screens out unintentional touches, and provide more relaxing
  and natural user experience. By linking their gaze and head behavior to their touch
  behavior, our work sheds light on the possibility of future tabletop technology
  to improve the understanding of users' input intention.
